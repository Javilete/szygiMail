# OVERVIEW

It's a simple frontend app for ISG Email Stub.

It's able to extract OTP Notification, Password Reset, User registration, User Re-registration emails and present them in demo-able way :-) in a Web Browser.

There's a fake email client and fake mobile phone for that purposes.

# DEPENDENCIES

It's a node application so you need to install npm and all project dependencies first.

cd szygiMail
npm install

# STARTING SERVER

PORT=80 npm start

If you're using mac or *nix system you can just execute go script (it'll install dependencies and everything)

./go

# URLs

Once application starts up it's available at this addresses:

Urls:

http://localhost/email.html <- This simulates regular Email client
http://localhost/mobile.html <- This is mobile phone simulator which reads only OTP Notification emails

Suggested approach is to add appropriate entries to /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1 mymail.com mobilephone.com szygimail.com szygiphone.com
